## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- LeafletJS API
- IPify API

### What I learned

How to use user inputs for search query
I tried using string concatenation for the search param but that didn't work so I went down a unproductive rabbit hole until I finally realized you just need to use backticks/ string interpolation... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Once I realized that I quickly figured out that I also needed to scope the userQuery variable to the function so that it updates with the event listener and not beforehand.

### Continued development

I didn't hide my API key because I ran out of time... üòÖ but in the future I'd hide the key using either Netlify functions or dotenv files and NodeJS. I'm not worried about this at the moment because it's a free API (with limited requests).

### Useful resources

Thanks to [Scott O'Hara](https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2014/06/24/pseudo-element-input.html) for teaching me that you can't add pseudo elements to input elements, you can only add them to container elements.

Getting the map going was pretty easy & getting it to update the coordinates was simple as well because the [leaflet docs](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) are great & easy to understand.
